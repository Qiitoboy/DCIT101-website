<h1 style="background-color:orange;">Introduction</h1>
<p style="color:green;">I go by the name Ransford Oduro Takyi popularly known as "QIITOBOY". I am a  computer science student in the University of Ghana, Legon.</br>
I was born and bred in Taifa , Accra and i had my secondary level education at Prempeh college in the Ashanti region.</br>
I am very glad  that am sharing my webpage with you and I know you will love it.
This website gives a brief description of the <em>Easter</em>  celebration and it's purpose.</p>
<h2  style="background-color:orange;">  WHAT IS EASTER</h2>
<p style="color:green;">Easter is a christian festival celebrated to mark the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ.<br>
Jesus Christ died to save and liberate mankind from eternal doom .
The christians strongly believe that it is through the death of Jesus Christ that they have gotten close to God.<br> 
This is  because after the first man Adam sinned ,man was separated from God. And that it was only the blood of Christ that could bring man close to God again</p>
<h3 style="background-color:orange;">HOW DID CHRIST DIE?</h3>
<P style="color:green;">According to the bible, Christ died by crucifixtion on a cross.<br> He was stripped naked and was beaten severely before he was sent out to be crucified.<br>
After receiving several stripes at his back, he was made to carry a tree to a mount called <b>"GOLGOTHA"</b > where he was crucified.</P>

<h4 style="background-color:orange;">THE RESURRECTION </h4>
<p style="color:green;">It is believed that  three days after Jesus Christ was killed ,he arose from the death.<br> 
So on the third day of every Easter , christians put on white to church to mark the resurrection of their savior.</p>
